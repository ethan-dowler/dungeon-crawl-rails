# Combat

## Action Point System

Battles are fought based on an action point (AP) system.

When a battle starts, all combatants start with 0 AP and gain AP throughout the battle.

The rate at which each combatant gains AP is based on their Speed Factor (SF).
- SF is calculated based on the combatant's Body (60%) and Mind (40%).
- If a combatant's SF is high, their actions will cost LESS than normal.
- Conversely, if a combatant's SF is low, their actions will cost MORE than normal.

It is possible to have perks that grant bonus SF for specific actions.
- A Body perk might reduce the AP cost of heavy attacks
- A Mind perk might reduce the AP cost for expensive mindforging techniques.

Each combatant spends AP until they decide to "pass" which causes all AP bars to start filling again until one hits 100. At that point, the combatant with 100 AP will take actions until they decided to "pass".

When a combatant takes an action, their enemy may take a reaction assuming they have enough AP to spend at that point.
